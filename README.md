# Forensic Analysis of a Suspect's iPhone for Criminal Evidence Recovery

**Project Summary**

This project involved conducting a digital forensic examination of an Apple iPhone 4S found in downtown Syracuse, NY, as part of a simulated law enforcement investigation for the Syracuse Police Department. The device was analyzed using Cellebrite UFED Reader, a premier mobile forensics tool used for extracting and analyzing data from mobile devices.

The investigation sought to identify the device owner, illegal activities, and associated contacts by examining key digital artifacts such as call logs, messages, contacts, calendar entries, Wi-Fi connections, and geolocation data. Through detailed artifact analysis, the forensic examination revealed communications and activities linking the suspect to illegal drug distribution.

The investigation successfully provided evidence such as the suspect’s ICCID, phone number, device identifiers, SMS/MMS messages, installed apps, calendar events, and location trails, which established a clear timeline of criminal activity and associations.

**Learning Points**
1. Learned to use Cellebrite UFED Reader to perform logical and physical extractions from mobile devices.
2. Understood how to analyze and correlate digital evidence (e.g., contacts, call logs, SMS/MMS messages, and geolocation data) to identify suspects and patterns of illegal activity.
3. Gained experience in interpreting ICCID, MAC addresses, and timestamp data to link devices to users and locations.
4. Strengthened skills in digital evidence documentation, hash verification, and maintaining forensic chain of custody.
5. Applied critical thinking and analytical reasoning to reconstruct user activity and derive conclusions from extracted data.
6. Learned to prepare a professional forensic report suitable for submission in a law enforcement or court setting.
